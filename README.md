# arduino-library-audio
Arduino Audio Library for stm32 platform

_There is one Audio library for Arduino Due (https://github.com/arduino-org/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/Audio). This library has only three "commands"_

_1. begin_<br>
_2. prepare_<br>
_3. write_

_This commands are not sufficient for Audio Interface of Otto board because there are no commands to use the microphones and to select the output channel._

# AUDIO API definition
## _(First Proposal)_

#### **Audio.begin(_device_, _rate_, _size_):**
Initialize the Audio Device
* _**device**_: set the device to be initialized.
  * _STD_: initialize the onboard audio codec
  * _HDMI_: initialize the HDMI audio codec
* _int **rate**_: sets the sample rate of the file to be reproduced or the acquisition datarate
* _int **size**_: is the size of audio buffer in milliseconds


#### **Audio.prepare(_buffer_, _samples_, _volumes_):**
Prepare the audio samples from the buffer and set the volumes
* _long **buffer**_: is the buffer containing the audio samples
* _int **samples**_: is the number of sample to play
* _int **volume**_: set the volume of the audio being played (value between 0 and 1023)


#### **Audio.play(_buffer_, _device_, _samples_):**
Write audio data from a buffer to a given device
* _long **buffer**_: is the buffer containing the audio samples
* _**device**_: select the output device
  * _HPOUT_: select the audio jack microphones
  * _SPKOUT_: select the pin header audio output connector
  * _HDMI_: select the HDMI audio output
* _int **samples**_: is the number of sample to play


#### **Audio.rec(_buffer_, _device_, _samples_):**
Read audio from a given input source and put the data in a given buffer
* _long **buffer**_: is the buffer containing the audio samples
* _**device**_: select the input device
  * _STDMIC_: select the onboard microphones connected to onboard codec
  * _MCUMIC_: select the onboard microphones connected to MCU
  * _EXTMIC_: select the audio jack microphones
* _int **samples**_: is the number of samples to record


### **Audio.pause(_device_):**
Pause the audio reproduction for a given output device
* _**device**_: select the device
  *  _STD_:  onboard audio codec
  * _HDMI_: HDMI audio codec


### **Audio.stop(_device_):**
Stop the audio reproduction for a given output device
* _**device**_: select the device
  * _STD_:  onboard audio codec
  * _HDMI_: HDMI audio codec

<br/>
## Remarks:

Francesco Alessi: This proposal, in my opinion is better than the second, because the commands are the same for all devices, and is possible to use one or another by change one argument.
